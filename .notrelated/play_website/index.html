        Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods sold in a given targeted time period. The
        delivery of a service for a cost is also considered a sale. A period during which goods are sold for a reduced
        price may also
        be referred to as a "sale".[1]

        The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in an interaction with a buyer, which may
        occur
        at the point of sale or in response to a purchase order from a customer. There is a passing of title (property
        or
        ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which
        transfer of
        ownership of the item will occur. The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be
        completed
        prior to the obligation of payment. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on
        behalf
        of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods
        in a
        store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including salesclerk, shop assistant, and retail clerk.

        In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United
        States, the
        laws governing sales of goods are mostly uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of
        the
        Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.

        HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from
        a web server or from local storage and render the documents intomultimedia web
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements
        are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
        tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can
        embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of
        web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
        former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video
        and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.
