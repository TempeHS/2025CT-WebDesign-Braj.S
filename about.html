    <h1>Sales are activities related to selling or the number of goods sold in a given targeted time period. The
        delivery of a
        service for a cost is also considered a sale. A period during which goods are sold for a reduced price may also
        be
        referred to as a "sale".[1]

        The seller, or the provider of the goods or services, completes a sale in an interaction with a buyer, which may
        occur
        at the point of sale or in response to a purchase order from a customer. There is a passing of title (property
        or
        ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which
        transfer of
        ownership of the item will occur. The seller, not the purchaser, typically executes the sale and it may be
        completed
        prior to the obligation of payment. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on
        behalf
        of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods
        in a
        store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including salesclerk, shop assistant, and retail clerk.

        In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United
        States, the
        laws governing sales of goods are mostly uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of
        the
        Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.</h1>
